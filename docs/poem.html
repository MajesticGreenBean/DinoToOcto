    <p>
    In modern times, where life meaning fades, <br>
    A tale of love unfolds in strangest of pace, <br>
    Two unexpected souls, in myriad shades, <br>
    Find solace amidst boring space.
    </p>

    <p>
    A dinosaur, scaly beast of bygone age, <br>
    Walking shell, with nothing more to chase, <br>
    Yet deep within, in his fossilized cage, <br>
    A longing wish, to be blessed with love's grace.
    </p>

    <p>
    An octopus, with arms that always explore, <br>
    A colorful life, goals and deep secrets to tell, <br>
    Her ink-black eyes, gazes up from ocean floors, <br>
    Dreaming of a love she has never felt.
    </p>

    <p>
    Amidst the chaos of life's frantic race, <br>
    Two hearts skipped a beat, for the first time this way, <br>
    Against odds and trials, hand in hand they keep, <br>
    Come! All struggles, together we face.
    </p>

    <p>
    Though dinosaurs and ocotpi may seem, <br>
    The most illogical pairing in life's grand scheme, <br>
    Through each new lifetime, they unite and reach, <br>
    A happy ending, again and again. <br>
    </p>
